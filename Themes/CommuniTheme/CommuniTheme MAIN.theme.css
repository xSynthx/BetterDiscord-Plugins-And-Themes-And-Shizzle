Please do not alter this theme or claim it as your own as it belongs to the community. Redistribution is fine but I would prefer if you were to point people to the GitHub URL. 
If you wish to be included in the theme, DM Nyte#7883 or create an issue on the GitHub
What your DM should contain:
Whether you want a GIFatar / custom avatar, a custom tag, or both
If it's a GIFatar / custom avatar then obviously I need a URL [HTTPS ONLY PLEASE]
If it's a custom tag, tell me what you want the compact version and the expanded version to say
