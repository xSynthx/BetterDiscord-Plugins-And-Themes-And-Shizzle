# Nyte's BetterDiscord Plugins and Themes

So, it appears you've found my repository, either by accident or purposely. Well, here I will be posting my BetterDiscord plugins and themes [there won't be many]

# CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS

1. The "CommuniTheme" [CURRENTSTATUS - AWAITING RELEASE]

A theme for the community that allows people to apply for custom tags and custom GIFatars WITHOUT paying for Nitro. Purely based on my love for the community :3. Create an issue in order to apply. Applications must contain:

- Whether you want a GIFatar / custom avatar, a custom tag, or both
- If it's a GIFatar / custom avatar then obviously I need a URL [HTTPS ONLY]
- If it's a custom tag, tell me what you want the compact version and the expanded version to say.
Restrictions:
THERE ARE NONE! You can have w h a t e v e r you want as your tag / GIFatar / custom avatar. HOWEVER, I will not include NSFW GIFatars / custom avatars or offensive tags in the main release, but people can always get the alternate release if they are ok with seeing those kinds of tags / GIFatars / custom avatars.
